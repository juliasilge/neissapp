## Don't Fall Down Your Stairs
### A Shiny App for the NEISS Data Set

This app explores the [`neiss`](https://github.com/hadley/neiss) data set of injuries due to consumer products from the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Check out [the app here](https://juliasilge.shinyapps.io/neiss_demographics/).

In the app, the user chooses
* sex/gender
* race/ethnicity
* age

and then the most common injuries are displayed.
